The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to 23 \u00b0C and stirred for 10 min before it was diluted with hexanes (30 mL) and EtOAc (15 mL) and \ufb01ltered through a pad of SiO2. The \ufb01ltrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give crude exocyclic ole\ufb01n 26 (90.2 mg, 0.173 mmol, quantitative yield), which was used in the next step without further puri\ufb01cation. To a stirred solution of the obtained exocyclic ole\ufb01n 26 (90.2 mg, 0.173 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in toluene (10 mL) at 23 \u00b0C were added n-Bu3SnH (100 \u00b5L, 0.346 mmol, 2.0 equiv) and AIBN (14.2 mg, 0.0865 mmol, 0.5 equiv). The resulting mixture was transferred and submerged into a preheated oil bath (90 \u00b0C) and stirred for 2 h before it was allowed to cool to 23 \u00b0C. The resulting mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (SiO2, hexanes\/EtOAc 20:1, v\/v  \u2192  2:1, v\/v) of the residue a\ufb00orded the corresponding organotin intermediate (80.1 mg, 0.102 mmol, 58% yield) as a colorless oil.  To a stirred solution of the residue obtained above (mixture of isomers, 80.1 mg, 0.102 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in MeOH (4 mL) at 23 \u00b0C was added p-TsOH\u2219H2O (17.5 mg, 0.102 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The resulting mixture was stirred for 45 min and then diluted with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (10 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 10 mL).
