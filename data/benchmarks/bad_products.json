1. Selected experimentation to construct the desired stereocenters (such as C1, C3 and C9) in A/B ring system. Attempt 1: We tried to convert the C9 hydroxyl group in 8b to C9 α-H via a typical Barton synthesize the corresponding thiocarbonyl derivatives, probably due to the huge steric hindrance of C9 hydroxyl group.  
2. Synthetic experimental procedures 2.1 General Information  Unless otherwise mentioned, all reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere under anhydrous conditions and all reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers without further purification. Solvent purification was conducted according to Purification of Laboratory Chemicals (Peerrin, D. D.; Armarego, W. L. and Perrins, D. R., Pergamon Press: Oxford, 1980). Yields refer to chromatographically and spectroscopically ( 1H NMR) homogeneous materials, unless otherwise stated. Reactions were monitored by Thin Layer Chromatography on plates (GF254) supplied by Yantai Chemicals (China) using UV light as visualizing agent, an ethanolic solution of phosphomolybdic acid, or basic aqueous potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and heat as developing agents. If not specially mentioned, flash column chromatography uses silica gel (200-300 mesh) supplied by Tsingtao Haiyang Chemicals (China), Preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) separations were carried out 0.50 mm Yantai (China) silica gel plates. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV500, Bruker ARX400, and calibrated using residual undeuterated solvent as an internal reference (CDCl3, δ 7.26 ppm  1H NMR, δ 77.0 ppm  13C NMR; CD3OD, δ 3.33 ppm  1H NMR, δ 49.0 ppm  13C NMR; CD2Cl2, δ 5.32 ppm  1H NMR, δ 54.0 ppm  13C NMR). The following abbreviations were used to explain the multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, b = broad, m = multiplet. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a Bruker Apex IV FTMS mass spectrometer using ESI (electrospray ionization). Infrared spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR Prestige 21, using thin films of the sample on KBr plates. Optical rotations were measured with a Rudolph autopol I automatic polarimeter using 10 cm glass cells with a sodium 589 nm filter.

Figure S20. The cerium calibration curve for the UV-vis spectrophotometric method and the measured Ce 4+ concentration.H2O2 concentration (cH2O2) was determined by a titration method using Ce(SO4)2. A linear calibration curve was established by the Ce 4+ absorbance at 316 nm from 0.125 to 1 mM. The yellow color Ce 4+ can be converted to colorless Ce 3+ following the following reaction:              2Ce 4 +  + H2O2→2Ce 3 +  + 2H  +  + O2cH2O2 was calculated by:                           𝐶𝐻2𝑂2 =12  ∙ ∆𝐶 𝐶𝑒 4 +where ΔCCe4+ is the change in the Ce 4+ concentration.  The structural characterization of COF-366-Co after the stability test. (a) A HAADF-
oxidant for wastewater remediation. Methylene blue (MB) was chosen as a representative organic contaminant. A acidified MB solution (200 mg L –1, pH = 1) with 0.1 mmol Fe 2+ was prepared as shown in Figure S20a. To 10 mL this dye solution, 5 mL catholytes obtained after a 3-hour discharge at 22 mA cm in either Ar (Reference bottle) or air saturation (sample bottle) were added. After a brief hand-shaking, the results are displayed in Figure S20b for comparison. It can be seen that the color of the sample bottle has fully diminished, leaving a clear and transparent solution. The MB concentration before and after the addition of the catholyte was further quantified by UV-vis spectroscopy. It can be found in Figure S20c that after the treatment, the MB solution in the sample bottle is close to zero, suggesting highly efficient MB removal.
