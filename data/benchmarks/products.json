Compound SI3  SI-53 Compound SI5   To a flame-dried 4-neck 5 L round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an addition funnel was added a mixture of SI4 (100 g, 71 mmol, 1.00 eq) and MTBE (800 mL) at 0 \u00b0C under continuous stream of nitrogen. Vinyl magnesium bromide (1070 mL, 106.9 mmol, 1.0 M in THF, 1.5 eq) was transferred via cannula into the addition funnel and added over 1 h at 0 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture was warmed to rt and stirred for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled to 15 \u00b0C, and NH4Cl (saturated aq., 1000 mL) was added. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with MTBE (300 mL).  The combined organics were concentrated under reduced pressure, and passed through a silica plug (100-200 mesh, 2% EtOAc in hexane). The fractions containing product were concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain SI5 (70 g, 80%) as a pale yellow liquid. The spectroscopic data for this compound were identical to those previously reported. 1 ",

The vial was cooled to -17 ºC and CH2Cl2 (1 mL) was added. Subsequently, Br2 (2.0 eq.) was added dropwise and the resulting solution was stirred at -17 ºC for 15 min. After completion, the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. To a stirred solution of solid residue in THF (1 mL), aqueous NaHCO3 (1 mL) was added dropwise. Following this, the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and subsequently diluted with 1 M aqueous HCl and CH2Cl2 (2 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 4 mL). The organic layers were collected, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The desired compound was isolated by column chromatography (silica gel 100-200 mesh size; hexane/ethyl acetate) to afford 8 (24 mg, 0.11 mmol, 79% yield) as a white solid and as a >20:1 mixture of diastereomers.
